# Hey there, I’m CJ 👋

I’m a 7th-grade coding enthusiast obsessed with HTML/JS and dreaming of building the ultimate AI someday. When I’m not smashing out code, you’ll find me:

- 🕹 Playing **TOTK** and **BOTW**, exploring every corner of Hyrule  
- 📚 Reading anime and book series like *SAO*, *Apothecary Diaries*, *JJK*, *Freiren*, and *Medalist*  
- 🎵 Vibing to **phonk** and making my brain hurt with beats  
- 🎾 Getting some tennis in (trying not to get destroyed by football jerks in art class)  

---

## 💻 Coding Stuff
- **Languages I rock:** TypeScript, HTML, JavaScript (soon Python 🐍)  
- **Current projects:** Websites, small games, AI experiments  
- **Goal:** Make an AI that does EVERYTHING. No compromises.

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- Buffalo Bills fan — yes, I’ll fight you if you hate them  
- Full-time anime critic, part-time web wizard  
- I judge bad CSS like it’s a personal attack

## 🔥 Currently Coding
> These projects are alive, chaotic, and probably messy.  
- Personal AI experiments 🤖  
- Tiny games & website projects 💻  
- Random JS hacks that break things occasionally 💥  

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Easter Eggs
- Hover over my badges. Some have secret messages. 👀  
- Check my pinned repos — there might be a “totally serious” AI project that’s just a meme.  
- The readme itself? Could be hiding a secret (or not, but imagine if it did 😏).
